# RubyCitizenship

- GIT, GITHUB, GITLAB
- Testing framework
A lot of other Rails developers used to use PHP, and were attracted to the Ruby world for technical reasons. Ruby developers are particularly eager to continuously evolve their tools. Rails was an early adopter of Git (revision control) and GitHub, and there's a strong focus on testing frameworks that is less common in PHP.

- HAML
- SASS, CSS, bournb,
A large number of developers and designers prefer to use the Haml template language and Sass CSS preprocessor, which are both native to Rails.

- small development
From a hiring perspective, a startup can assume that if a developer is using Rails (or another modern web framework) that they are keeners who are interested in skills development and are likely involved in contributing to open source projects. This usually indicates a personality type that is a good cultural fit for many small development teams.

- Macs
Rails developers often use Macs. For some people, this means nothing. For others, this means the difference between getting hired or passed over. YMMV.

- Full stack web development
- Highly scalable sites
- Caching, load balancing, redundancy
- Worker queues, delayed process
- thread and process management, 
- non-relational data storage, 
- filesystem and kernel optimization, 
- proxy, reverse-proxy configuration
- monitoring are al
- Deployment management(Capistrano, Chelf)
Rails developers are often keenly aware of full-stack web development practices to build highly scalable web sites. Caching, worker queues, thread and process management, non-relational data storage, filesystem and kernel optimization, proxy configuration, redundancy and monitoring are all discussed in the same breath as Rails development on a regular basis.

- Amazon S3, Heroku
There are some really excellent commercial infrastructures available for staging and deployment. Heroku deserves special mention for being particularly easy to get started with.

In conclusion, the excitement around Rails is justified. A small team can get a minimum viable product into beta very quickly using tools that are fun to work with. Embracing constraints and the conventions (naming, pluralization, project structure) really do enable new talent to join a project and get up to speed quickly.

To be clear, none of these reasons detract in any way from reasons someone might enjoy using other excellent tools such as Python (Django) or JavaScript (Node.js). In fact, many Rails developers pride themselves on knowing several languages and frameworks for fun and personal development.
